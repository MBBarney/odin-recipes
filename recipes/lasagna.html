    <p>Just like Mom used to make. Cheesy goodness!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Go to Luigi's local artisan lasagna-makings shop.</li>
        <li>Say bonjourno to Luigi.</li>
        <li>Tell Luigi you want half a kilo of pasta, a gallon of tomato sauce, a bucket of ricatta, half a kilo of mozarella, and 100g of his secret spice blend.</li>
        <li>Back at home, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with 2l of water. Soak the pasta until flexible.</li>
        <li>Cover the bottom of a cake pan with a single layer of pasta.</li>
        <li>Ladle in tomato sauce. Spread to an even thickness of 1 cm.</li>

        <li>Add ricatta, 1 cm thick.</li>
        <li>Add a layer of mozarella.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle Luigi's secret spice blend in a generous quantity.</li>
        <li>Top with a third layer of pasta, a little tomato sauce, and a flourish of mozarella.</li>
        <li>Bake for 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven at 35 minutes. Allow to cool for 5 minutes before cutting.</li>
        <li>Serve hot.</li>
        <li>Tell your guests "it's nothing. Just a little something you whipped up from leftovers.</li>
        <li>Send a thank-you note to Luigi!</li>
